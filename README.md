# 🧬 Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression

This project applies **logistic regression** to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset**.

## 📌 Overview

The goal is to build a simple yet effective machine learning model that can help in early diagnosis of breast cancer. The project covers data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository / scikit-learn datasets
* **Features**: Mean, standard error, and worst values of cell nuclei measurements
* **Target**: `Diagnosis` — B (Benign) or M (Malignant)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, train\_test\_split, accuracy\_score)
* Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ananyaa00051/Breast-Cancer-Detection.git
   cd Breast-Cancer-Detection
   ```

2. Open the notebook:

   ```
   jupyter notebook Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin_Diagnosis_using_Logistic_Regression.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells to see data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation results.

## 📈 Results

* Achieved high accuracy using logistic regression
* Used correlation heatmap to identify key features
* Evaluated model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## ✅ Key Learnings

* How to apply logistic regression for binary classification
* Importance of feature correlation and data scaling
* Model performance evaluation using sklearn tools
