An interactive Streamlit-based web application that enables users to:

- Predict the likelihood of breast cancer using an XGBoost model
- Understand predictions using SHAP explainability
- Chat with a locally-hosted AI assistant named **KASH** (Knowledge Assistant for Self-Health) powered by **Ollama + Mistral LLM**



## üöÄ Features

### 1. üéØ **Breast Cancer Prediction using XGBoost**
- Trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset
- Uses features like `mean radius`, `mean texture`, etc.
- Outputs binary classification: **Benign** or **Malignant**
- Scikit-learn preprocessing and model pipeline

### 2. üìä **Feature Importance Visualization**
- Built-in SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) plots
- Understand how each feature impacts the model's prediction

### 3. üß† **KASH: Local AI Chatbot Assistant**
- Chatbot interface within the app
- Uses the `mistral` model from **Ollama**
- Runs fully offline (no API needed)
- Supports custom prompts like:
  - ‚ÄúWhat is breast cancer?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúHow to interpret biopsy results?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúExplain the role of radius_mean in diagnosis.‚Äù

### 4. üóÉÔ∏è **Explainability**
- SHAP summary plots provide transparent decision-making insights

## üß™ Sample Prompts for KASH

```
- What are the early symptoms of breast cancer?
- How accurate is a biopsy?
- Can you explain the SHAP plot I see?
- What is a benign tumor?
- Is radius_mean a strong indicator of cancer?
```
